/**
 * Disposable is used to dispose the subscription when an Observer no longer wants to listen to
 * Observable. In android disposable are very useful in avoiding memory leaks.
    Letâ€™s say you are making a long running network call and updating the UI. By the time network
    call completes its work, if the activity / fragment is already destroyed,
    as the Observer subscription is still alive, it tries to update already destroyed activity.
    In this case it can throw a memory leak. So using the Disposables, the un-subscription can be
    when the activity is destroyed.
